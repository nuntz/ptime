Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

`ptime` -- a command line solution that scan all the photos in a folder and can display: 1) the oldest photo taken, 2) the most recent photo taken, and 3) a visual histogram showing the number of photos for each year.

Save the output to @SPEC.md
